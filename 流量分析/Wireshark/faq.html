<h3 id="_what_is_wireshark">What is Wireshark?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark® is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture and
interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. It has a
rich and powerful feature set and is world&#8217;s most popular tool of its
kind. It runs on most computing platforms including Windows, macOS,
Linux, and UNIX. Network professionals, security experts, developers,
and educators around the world use it regularly. It is freely available
as open source, and is released under the GNU General Public License
version 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is developed and maintained by a global team of protocol experts,
and it is an example of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology">disruptive
technology</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark used to be known as Ethereal®. See the next question for
details about the name change. If you&#8217;re still using Ethereal, it is
strongly recommended that you upgrade to Wireshark as Ethereal is
unsupported and has known security vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3 id="_what_kind_of_shark_is_wireshark">What kind of shark is Wireshark?</h3>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_is_wireshark_pronounced_spelled_and_capitalized">How is Wireshark pronounced, spelled and capitalized?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark is pronounced as the word <em>wire</em> followed immediately by
the word <em>shark</em>. Exact pronunciation and emphasis may vary depending on
your locale (e.g. Arkansas).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s spelled with a capital <em>W</em>, followed by a lower-case <em>ireshark</em>.
It is not a CamelCase word, i.e., <em>WireShark</em> is incorrect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_much_does_wireshark_cost">How much does Wireshark cost?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark is "free software"; you can download it without paying any
license fee. The version of Wireshark you download isn&#8217;t a "demo"
version, with limitations not present in a "full" version; it <em>is</em> the
full version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The license under which Wireshark is issued is
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">the GNU General Public License
version 2</a>. See
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html">the GNU GPL
FAQ</a> for some more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_but_i_just_paid_someone_on_ebay_for_a_copy_of_wireshark_did_i_get_ripped_off">But I just paid someone on eBay for a copy of Wireshark! Did I get ripped off?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That depends. Did they provide any sort of value-added product or
service, such as installation support, installation media, training,
trace file analysis, or funky-colored shark-themed socks? Probably not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark is <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">available for
anyone to download, absolutely free, at any time</a>. Paying for a copy
implies that you should get something for your money.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_can_i_use_wireshark_commercially">Can I use Wireshark commercially?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, if, for example, you mean "I work for a commercial organization;
can I use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic in our
company&#8217;s networks or in our customer&#8217;s networks?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you mean "Can I use Wireshark as part of my commercial product?",
see <a href="#derived_work_gpl">the next entry in the FAQ</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_can_i_use_wireshark_as_part_of_my_commercial_product">Can I use Wireshark as part of my commercial product?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted, Wireshark is licensed under
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">the GNU General Public
License, version 2</a>. The GPL imposes conditions on your use of GPL&#8217;ed
code in your own products; you cannot, for example, make a "derived
work" from Wireshark, by making modifications to it, and then sell the
resulting derived work and not allow recipients to give away the
resulting work. You must also make the changes you&#8217;ve made to the
Wireshark source available to all recipients of your modified version;
those changes must also be licensed under the terms of the GPL. See the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html">GPL FAQ</a> for
more details; in particular, note the answer to
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#GPLCommercially">the
question about modifying a GPLed program and selling it commercially</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#LinkingWithGPL">the
question about linking GPLed code with other code to make a proprietary
program</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can combine a GPLed program such as Wireshark and a commercial
program as long as they communicate "at arm&#8217;s length", as per
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#GPLInProprietarySystem">this
item in the GPL FAQ</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recommend keeping Wireshark and your product completely separate,
communicating over sockets or pipes. If you&#8217;re loading any part of
Wireshark as a DLL, you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_can_you_help_me_fill_out_this_compliance_form_so_that_i_can_use_wireshark">Can you help me fill out this compliance form so that I can use Wireshark?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need help filling out individual items in the form, you’re certainly free to <a href="#wheretogethelp">ask the community</a> for help.
If you want someone within the project to fill out the form for you, we simply can’t help you.
Wireshark is developed by a team of volunteers, and while we try to make sure that it’s as easy as possible to obtain and use, filling out a form would mean taking precious time away from other aspects of the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_can_you_sign_this_legal_agreement_so_that_i_can_use_wireshark">Can you sign this legal agreement so that I can use Wireshark?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably not.
As with the previous question, we really do want you to be able to use Wireshark.
However, while we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have developers, educators, and networking experts volunteer their time, so far we haven&#8217;t had any attorneys volunteer to review contracts for us pro bono.
Asking us to sign a contract is asking us to spend time reviewing that contract and/or paying for an attorney to do so that you can use Wireshark for free.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_protocols_are_currently_supported">What protocols are currently supported?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are currently hundreds of supported protocols and media.
Details can be found in the
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html">wireshark(1)</a>
man page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_are_there_any_plans_to_support_your_favorite_protocol">Are there any plans to support {your favorite protocol}?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Support for particular protocols is added to Wireshark as a result of
people contributing that support; no formal plans for adding support for
particular protocols in particular future releases exist.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_can_wireshark_read_capture_files_from_your_favorite_network_analyzer">Can Wireshark read capture files from {your favorite network analyzer}?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Support for particular capture file formats is added to Wireshark as
a result of people contributing that support; no formal plans for adding
support for particular capture file formats in particular future
releases exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a network analyzer writes out files in a format already supported by
Wireshark (e.g., in libpcap format), Wireshark may already be able to
read them, unless the analyzer has added its own proprietary extensions
to that format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a network analyzer writes out files in its own format, or has added
proprietary extensions to another format, in order to make Wireshark
read captures from that network analyzer, we would either have to have a
specification for the file format, or the extensions, sufficient to give
us enough information to read the parts of the file relevant to
Wireshark, or would need at least one capture file in that format <strong>AND</strong>
a detailed textual analysis of the packets in that capture file (showing
packet time stamps, packet lengths, and the top-level packet header) in
order to reverse-engineer the file format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that there is no guarantee that we will be able to
reverse-engineer a capture file format.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_devices_can_wireshark_use_to_capture_packets">What devices can Wireshark use to capture packets?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark can read live data from Ethernet, Token-Ring, FDDI, serial
(PPP and SLIP) (if the OS on which it&#8217;s running allows Wireshark to do
so), 802.11 wireless LAN (if the OS on which it&#8217;s running allows
Wireshark to do so), ATM connections (if the OS on which it&#8217;s running
allows Wireshark to do so), and the "any" device supported on Linux by
recent versions of libpcap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/CaptureSetup/NetworkMedia">the list of
supported capture media on various OSes</a> for details (several items in
there say "Unknown", which doesn&#8217;t mean "Wireshark can&#8217;t capture on
them", it means "we don&#8217;t know whether it can capture on them"; we
expect that it will be able to capture on many of them, but we haven&#8217;t
tried it ourselves - if you try one of those types and it works, please
update the wiki page accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can also read a variety of capture file formats, including:</p>

<p>Each major release branch of Wireshark supports the versions of Windows that are within their product lifecycle at the time of the “.0” release for that branch.
For example, Wireshark 3.2.0 was released in December 2019, shortly before Windows 7 reached the end of its extended support in January 2020. As a result, each of the Wireshark 3.2.<em>x</em> releases supports Windows 7, even after January 2020.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might be because the interface on which you&#8217;re capturing is
plugged into an Ethernet or Token Ring switch; on a switched network,
unicast traffic between two ports will not necessarily appear on other
ports - only broadcast and multicast traffic will be sent to all ports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that even if your machine is plugged into a hub, the "hub" may be
a switched hub, in which case you&#8217;re still on a switched network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note also that on the Linksys Web site, they say that their
auto-sensing hubs "broadcast the 10Mb packets to the port that operate
at 10Mb only and broadcast the 100Mb packets to the ports that operate
at 100Mb only", which would indicate that if you sniff on a 10Mb port,
you will not see traffic coming sent to a 100Mb port, and <em>vice versa</em>.
This problem has also been reported for Netgear dual-speed hubs, and may
exist for other "auto-sensing" or "dual-speed" hubs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some switches have the ability to replicate all traffic on all ports to
a single port so that you can plug your analyzer into that single port
to sniff all traffic. You would have to check the documentation for the
switch to see if this is possible and, if so, to see how to do this. See
<a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/SwitchReference">the switch reference page</a> on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis">the Wireshark Wiki</a> for information on some
switches. (Note that it&#8217;s a Wiki, so you can update or fix that
information, or add additional information on those switches or
information on new switches, yourself.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note also that many firewall/NAT boxes have a switch built into them;
this includes many of the "cable/DSL router" boxes. If you have a box of
that sort, that has a switch with some number of Ethernet ports into
which you plug machines on your network, and another Ethernet port used
to connect to a cable or DSL modem, you can, at least, sniff traffic
between the machines on your network and the Internet by plugging the
Ethernet port on the router going to the modem, the Ethernet port on the
modem, and the machine on which you&#8217;re running Wireshark into a hub
(make sure it&#8217;s not a switching hub, and that, if it&#8217;s a dual-speed hub,
all three of those ports are running at the same speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your machine is <em>not</em> plugged into a switched network or a
dual-speed hub, or it is plugged into a switched network but the port is
set up to have all traffic replicated to it, the problem might be that
the network interface on which you&#8217;re capturing doesn&#8217;t support
"promiscuous" mode, or because your OS can&#8217;t put the interface into
promiscuous mode. Normally, network interfaces supply to the host only:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>packets sent to one of that host&#8217;s link-layer addresses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>broadcast packets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multicast packets sent to a multicast address that the host has
configured the interface to accept.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most network interfaces can also be put in "promiscuous" mode, in which
they supply to the host all network packets they see. Wireshark will try
to put the interface on which it&#8217;s capturing into promiscuous mode
unless the "Capture packets in promiscuous mode" option is turned off in
the "Capture Options" dialog box, and TShark will try to put the
interface on which it&#8217;s capturing into promiscuous mode unless the <code>-p</code>
option was specified. However, some network interfaces don&#8217;t support
promiscuous mode, and some OSes might not allow interfaces to be put
into promiscuous mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the interface is not running in promiscuous mode, it won&#8217;t see any
traffic that isn&#8217;t intended to be seen by your machine. It <strong>will</strong> see
broadcast packets, and multicast packets sent to a multicast MAC address
the interface is set up to receive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should ask the vendor of your network interface whether it supports
promiscuous mode. If it does, you should ask whoever supplied the driver
for the interface (the vendor, or the supplier of the OS you&#8217;re running
on your machine) whether it supports promiscuous mode with that network
interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of wireless LAN interfaces, it appears that, when those
interfaces are promiscuously sniffing, they&#8217;re running in a
significantly different mode from the mode that they run in when they&#8217;re
just acting as network interfaces (to the extent that it would be a
significant effort for those drivers to support for promiscuously
sniffing <em>and</em> acting as regular network interfaces at the same time),
so it may be that Windows drivers for those interfaces don&#8217;t support
promiscuous mode.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;re probably not seeing <em>any</em> packets other than unicast packets

will normally send to a port only unicast traffic sent to the MAC

traffic - it won&#8217;t send to that port unicast traffic sent to a MAC
address for some other interface - and a network interface not in

address for that interface, broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic
sent to a multicast MAC address the interface is set up to receive.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark can capture only the packets that the packet capture
library - libpcap on UNIX-flavored OSes, and the Npcap port to Windows
of libpcap on Windows - can capture, and libpcap/Npcap can capture only
the packets that the OS&#8217;s raw packet capture mechanism (or the Npcap
driver, and the underlying OS networking code and network interface
drivers, on Windows) will allow it to capture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless the OS always supplies packets with errors such as invalid CRCs
to the raw packet capture mechanism, or can be configured to do so,
invalid CRCs to the raw packet capture mechanism, Wireshark - and other
programs that capture raw packets, such as tcpdump - cannot capture
those packets. You will have to determine whether your OS needs to be so
configured and, if so, can be so configured, configure it if necessary
and possible, and make whatever changes to libpcap and the packet
capture program you&#8217;re using are necessary, if any, to support capturing
those packets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most OSes probably do <strong>not</strong> support capturing packets with invalid CRCs
on Ethernet, and probably do not support it on most other link-layer
types. Some drivers on some OSes do support it, such as some Ethernet
drivers on FreeBSD; in those OSes, you might always get those packets,
or you might only get them if you capture in promiscuous mode (you&#8217;d
have to determine which is the case).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that libpcap does not currently supply to programs that use it an
indication of whether the packet&#8217;s CRC was invalid (because the drivers
themselves do not supply that information to the raw packet capture
mechanism); therefore, Wireshark will not indicate which packets had CRC
errors unless the FCS was captured (see the next question) and you&#8217;re
using Wireshark 0.9.15 and later, in which case Wireshark will check the
CRC and indicate whether it&#8217;s correct or not.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be capturing on what might be called a "VLAN interface" -
the way a particular OS makes VLANs plug into the networking stack
might, for example, be to have a network device object for the physical
interface, which takes VLAN packets, strips off the VLAN header and
constructs an Ethernet header, and passes that packet to an internal
network device object for the VLAN, which then passes the packets onto
various higher-level protocol implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to see the raw Ethernet packets, rather than "de-VLANized"
packets, you would have to capture not on the virtual interface for the
VLAN, but on the interface corresponding to the physical network device,
if possible. See <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/CaptureSetup/VLAN">the
Wireshark Wiki item on VLAN capturing</a> for details.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_does_wireshark_hang_after_i_stop_a_capture">Why does Wireshark hang after I stop a capture?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most likely reason for this is that Wireshark is trying to look
up an IP address in the capture to convert it to a name (so that, for
example, it can display the name in the source address or destination
address columns), and that lookup process is taking a very long time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark calls a routine in the OS of the machine on which it&#8217;s
running to convert of IP addresses to the corresponding names. That
routine probably does one or more of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a search of a system file listing IP addresses and names;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a lookup using DNS;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on UNIX systems, a lookup using NIS;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Windows systems, a NetBIOS-over-TCP query.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a DNS server that&#8217;s used in an address lookup is not responding, the
lookup will fail, but will only fail after a timeout while the system
routine waits for a reply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, on Windows systems, if the DNS lookup of the address
fails, either because the server isn&#8217;t responding or because there are
no records in the DNS that could be used to map the address to a name, a
NetBIOS-over-TCP query will be made. That query involves sending a
message to the NetBIOS-over-TCP name service on that machine, asking for
the name and other information about the machine. If the machine isn&#8217;t
running software that responds to those queries - for example, many
non-Windows machines wouldn&#8217;t be running that software - the lookup will
only fail after a timeout. Those timeouts can cause the lookup to take a
long time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you disable network address-to-name translation - for example, by
turning off the "Enable network name resolution" option in the "Capture
Options" dialog box for starting a network capture - the lookups of the
address won&#8217;t be done, which may speed up the process of reading the
capture file after the capture is stopped. You can make that setting the
default by selecting "Preferences" from the "Edit" menu, turning off the
"Enable network name resolution" option in the "Name resolution" options
in the preferences dialog box, and using the "Save" button in that
dialog box; note that this will save <em>all</em> your current preference
settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Wireshark hangs when reading a capture even with network name
resolution turned off, there might, for example, be a bug in one of
Wireshark&#8217;s dissectors for a protocol causing it to loop infinitely. If
you&#8217;re not running the most recent release of Wireshark, you should
first upgrade to that release, as, if there&#8217;s a bug of that sort, it
might&#8217;ve been fixed in a release after the one you&#8217;re running. If the
hang occurs in the most recent release of Wireshark, the bug should be
reported to <a href="mailto:wireshark-dev@wireshark.org">the Wireshark developers'
mailing list</a> at <code>wireshark-dev@wireshark.org</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On UNIX-flavored OSes, please try to force Wireshark to dump core, by
sending it a <code>SIGABRT</code> signal (usually signal 6) with the <code>kill</code>
command, and then get a stack trace if you have a debugger installed. A
stack trace can be obtained by using your debugger (<code>gdb</code> in this
example), the Wireshark binary, and the resulting core file. Here&#8217;s an
example of how to use the gdb command <code>backtrace</code> to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ gdb wireshark core
(gdb) backtrace
..... prints the stack trace
(gdb) quit
$</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core dump file may be named "wireshark.core" rather than "core" on
some platforms (e.g., BSD systems).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, if at all possible, please send a copy of the capture file that
caused the problem. When capturing packets, Wireshark normally writes
captured packets to a temporary file, which will probably be in <code>/tmp</code>
or <code>/var/tmp</code> on UNIX-flavored OSes, <code>\TEMP</code> on the main system disk
(normally <code>\Documents and Settings\`your login name
`\Local Settings\Temp</code> on the main system disk on Windows XP and
Server 2003, and <code>\Users\your login name\AppData\Local\Temp</code> on the main
system disk on Windows Vista and later, so the capture file will
probably be there. If you are capturing on a single interface, it will
have a name of the form,
<code>wireshark_&lt;iface&gt;_YYYYmmddHHMMSS_XXXXXX.&lt;fmt&gt;</code>, where &lt;fmt&gt; is the
capture file format (pcap or pcapng), and &lt;iface&gt; is the actual name of
the interface you are capturing on; otherwise, if you are capturing on
multiple interfaces, it will have a name of the form,
<code>wireshark_&lt;N&gt;_interfaces_YYYYmmddHHMMSS_XXXXXX.&lt;fmt&gt;</code>, where &lt;N&gt; is the
number of simultaneous interfaces you are capturing on. Please don&#8217;t
send a trace file greater than 1 MB when compressed; instead, make it
available via FTP or HTTP, or say it&#8217;s available but leave it up to a
developer to ask for it. If the trace file contains sensitive
information (e.g., passwords), then please do not send it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark gets time stamps from libpcap/Npcap, and libpcap/Npcap get
them from the OS kernel, so Wireshark - and any other program using
libpcap, such as tcpdump - is at the mercy of the time stamping code in
the OS for time stamps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At least on x86-based machines, Linux can get high-resolution time
stamps on newer processors with the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) register;
for example, Intel x86 processors, starting with the Pentium Pro, and
including all x86 processors since then, have had a TSC, and other
vendors probably added the TSC at some point to their families of x86
processors. The Linux kernel must be configured with the CONFIG_X86_TSC
option enabled in order to use the TSC. Make sure this option is enabled
in your kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, some Linux distributions may have bugs in their versions
of the kernel that cause packets not to be given high-resolution time
stamps even if the TSC is enabled. See, for example, bug 61111 for Red
Hat Linux 7.2. If your distribution has a bug such as this, you may have
to run a standard kernel from kernel.org in order to get high-resolution
time stamps.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>That depends on the operating system on which you&#8217;re running, and on
the 802.11 interface on which you&#8217;re capturing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would probably require that you capture in promiscuous mode or in
the mode called "monitor mode" or "RFMON mode". On some platforms, or
with some cards, this might require that you capture in monitor mode -
promiscuous mode might not be sufficient. If you want to capture traffic
on networks other than the one with which you&#8217;re associated, you will
have to capture in monitor mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not all operating systems support capturing non-data packets and, even
on operating systems that do support it, not all drivers, and thus not
all interfaces, support it. Even on those that do, monitor mode might
not be supported by the operating system or by the drivers for all
interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> an interface running in monitor mode will, on most if not all
platforms, not be able to act as a regular network interface; putting it
into monitor mode will, in effect, take your machine off of whatever
network it&#8217;s on as long as the interface is in monitor mode, allowing it
only to passively capture packets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that you should disable name resolution when capturing in
monitor mode; otherwise, when Wireshark (or TShark, or tcpdump) tries to
display IP addresses as host names, it will probably block for a long
time trying to resolve the name because it will not be able to
communicate with any DNS or NIS servers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the packets that have incorrect TCP checksums are all being sent
by the machine on which Wireshark is running, this is probably because
the network interface on which you&#8217;re capturing does TCP checksum
offloading. That means that the TCP checksum is added to the packet by
the network interface, not by the OS&#8217;s TCP/IP stack; when capturing on
an interface, packets being sent by the host on which you&#8217;re capturing
are directly handed to the capture interface by the OS, which means that
they are handed to the capture interface without a TCP checksum being
added to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only way to prevent this from happening would be to disable TCP
checksum offloading, but</p>

<div class="olist arabic">

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, you can disable the check that Wireshark does of the TCP
checksum, so that it won&#8217;t report any packets as having TCP checksum
errors, and so that it won&#8217;t refuse to do TCP reassembly due to a packet
having an incorrect TCP checksum. That can be set as an Wireshark
preference by selecting "Preferences" from the "Edit" menu, opening up
the "Protocols" list in the left-hand pane of the "Preferences" dialog
box, selecting "TCP", from that list, turning off the "Check the
validity of the TCP checksum when possible" option, clicking "Save" if
you want to save that setting in your preference file, and clicking
"OK".</p>

<h3 id="_why_doesnt_wireshark_correctly_identify_rtp_packets_it_shows_them_only_as_udp">Why doesn&#8217;t Wireshark correctly identify RTP packets? It shows them only as UDP.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark can identify a UDP datagram as containing a packet of a
particular protocol running atop UDP only if</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The protocol in question has a particular standard port number, and
the UDP source or destination port number is that port</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packets of that protocol can be identified by looking for a
"signature" of some type in the packet - i.e., some data that, if
Wireshark finds it in some particular part of a packet, means that the
packet is almost certainly a packet of that type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some <em>other</em> traffic earlier in the capture indicated that, for
example, UDP traffic between two particular addresses and ports will be
RTP traffic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RTP doesn&#8217;t have a standard port number, so 1) doesn&#8217;t work; it doesn&#8217;t,
as far as I know, have any "signature", so 2) doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That leaves 3). If there&#8217;s RTSP traffic that sets up an RTP session,
then, at least in some cases, the RTSP dissector will set things up so
that subsequent RTP traffic will be identified. Currently, that&#8217;s the
only place we do that; there may be other places.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there will always be places where Wireshark is simply
<strong>incapable</strong> of deducing that a given UDP flow is RTP; a mechanism would
be needed to allow the user to specify that a given conversation should
be treated as RTP. As of Wireshark 0.8.16, such a mechanism exists; if
you select a UDP or TCP packet, the right mouse button menu will have a
"Decode As&#8230;&#8203;" menu item, which will pop up a dialog box letting you
specify that the source port, the destination port, or both the source
and destination ports of the packet should be dissected as some
particular protocol.</p>

<h3 id="_why_doesnt_wireshark_show_yahoo_messenger_packets_in_captures_that_contain_yahoo_messenger_traffic">Why doesn&#8217;t Wireshark show Yahoo Messenger packets in captures that contain Yahoo Messenger traffic?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark only recognizes as Yahoo Messenger traffic packets to or
from TCP port 3050 that begin with "YPNS", "YHOO", or "YMSG". TCP
segments that start with the middle of a Yahoo Messenger packet that
takes more than one TCP segment will not be recognized as Yahoo
Messenger packets (even if the TCP segment also contains the beginning
of another Yahoo Messenger packet).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You cannot use the name of a saved display filter as a filter. To
filter the display, you can enter a display filter expression - <strong>not</strong>
the name of a saved display filter - in the "Filter:" box at the bottom
of the display, and type the &lt;Enter&gt; key or press the "Apply" button
(that does not require you to have a saved filter), or, if you want to
use a saved filter, you can press the "Filter:" button, select the
filter in the dialog box that pops up, and press the "OK" button.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to do this when capturing, you can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a feature
that would be hard to implement in capture filters without changes to
the capture filter code, which, on many platforms, is in the OS kernel
and, on other platforms, is in the libpcap library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After capture, you can search for text by selecting <em>Edit→Find
Packet&#8230;&#8203;</em> and making sure <em>String</em> is selected. Alternately, you can
use the "contains" display filter operator or "matches" operator if it&#8217;s
supported on your system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some viruses/worms there might be a capture filter to recognize
the virus traffic. Check the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/CaptureFilters">CaptureFilters</a> page on the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis">Wireshark Wiki</a> to see if anybody&#8217;s added
such a filter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that Wireshark was not designed to be an intrusion detection
system; you might be able to use it as an IDS, but in most cases
software designed to be an IDS, such as <a href="https://www.snort.org/">Snort</a> or
<a href="https://www.prelude-siem.org/">Prelude</a>, will probably work better.</p>

<h3 id="_whats_up_with_the_name_change_is_wireshark_a_fork">What&#8217;s up with the name change? Is Wireshark a fork?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May of 2006, Gerald Combs (the original author of Ethereal) went
to work for CACE Technologies (best known for WinPcap). Unfortunately,
he had to leave the Ethereal trademarks behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This left the project in an awkward position. The only reasonable way
to ensure the continued success of the project was to change the name.
This is how Wireshark was born.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark is almost (but not quite) a fork. Normally a "fork" of an
open source project results in two names, web sites, development teams,
support infrastructures, etc. This is the case with Wireshark except for
one notable exception&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;every member of the core development team is
now working on Wireshark. There has been no active development on
Ethereal since the name change. Several parts of the Ethereal web site`
(such as the mailing lists, source code repository, and build farm) have
gone offline.</p>
