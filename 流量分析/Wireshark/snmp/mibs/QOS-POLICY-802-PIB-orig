        the EtherType field follows the 802 MAC source address. For
        802.2 LLC/SNAP encapsulation, the EtherType value follows the

        Note that this identifier is used in instances of the
        qosAclTarget class to associate an 802 ACL with an interface
        set and action. An active ACL Target association prohibits
        the deletion of all of the qos802AclDefinition instances
        with a given qos802AclDefinitionAclId (i.e., at least one
        entry for the specific qos802AclDefinitionAclId must be
        present in this table) until the ACL Target association is
        terminated."

qos802AclDefinitionAceId OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX         PolicyInstanceId
    STATUS         current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This attribute identifies the 802 ACE in the qos802AceTable
        that is associated with the 802 ACL specified by
        qos802AclDefinitionAclId object. The corresponding instance
        in the qos802Ace class must exist prior to being associated
        with a 802 ACL.

        Attempting to specify an unknown class instance will result
        in an appropriate error indication being returned to the
        entity that is attempting to install the conflicting entry.
        For example, a 'priUnknown(2)' error indication is returned
        to the policy server in this situation."

qos802AclDefinitionAceOrder OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX         Unsigned32
    STATUS         current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The precedence of the 802 ACE, identified via the
        qos802AclDefinitionAceId object, with regard to evaluation
        order. The precedence determines the order of evaluation of
        this ACE in relation to related 802 ACEs that are associated
        with an ACL. An ACE with a given precedence order in the
        access control list is evaluated before one with a higher-
        valued precedence order.

        Precedence values within a group must be unique otherwise
        instance installation will be prohibited and an error

        value will be returned.

        Note that qos802AclDefinitionAceOrder values within a given
        ACL need not be contiguous."
