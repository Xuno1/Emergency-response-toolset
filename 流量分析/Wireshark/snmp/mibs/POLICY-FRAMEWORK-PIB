-- Device Configuration Group

-- This group contains device configuration information.  This

-- configuration of the device.  This configuration is generally
-- reported to the PDP (i.e., the policy server) when configuration
-- is performed by the policy server so that the PDP can determine
-- what policies to download to the PEP (i.e., the device). Class
-- instances may also be downloaded by a network manager prior to
-- static configuration.

        Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a class attribute,

        string corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th attribute, and the
        least significant bit of the i-th octet corresponding to the

        whether or not the corresponding class attribute is currently
        supported, with a '1' indicating support and a '0' indicating
        no support. If the value of this bit mask is N bits long and
