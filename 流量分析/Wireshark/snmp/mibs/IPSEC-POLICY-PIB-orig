     DESCRIPTION 
   "An octet string that identifies an overall range of calendar 
   dates and times over which a policy rule is valid.  It reuses the 
   format for an explicit time period defined in RFC 2445 : a string 
   representing a starting date and time, in which the character 'T'  
   indicates the beginning of the time portion, followed by the 
   solidus character '/', followed by a similar string representing 
   an end date and time.  The first date indicates the beginning of 
   the range, while the second date indicates the end.  Thus, the 
   second date and time must be later than the first.  Date/times are 
   expressed as substrings of the form yyyymmddThhmmss.  
    
   There are also two special cases: 
    
   -  If the first date/time is replaced with the string 
   THISANDPRIOR, then the property indicates that a policy rule is 
   valid [from now] until the date/time that appears after the '/'. 
    
   - If the second date/time is replaced with the string 
   THISANDFUTURE, then the property indicates that a policy rule 
   becomes valid on the date/time that appears before the '/', and 
   remains valid from that point on.

   indicates that the policy is valid for that day, and the value '0' 
   indicates that it is not valid.

   A  time  string beginning with the character 'T', followed by the

   first time indicates the beginning of the range, while the second 
   time indicates the end.  Times are expressed as substrings of the 
   form Thhmmss. 
    
   The second substring always identifies a later time than the first 
   substring.  To allow for ranges that span midnight, however, the 
   value of the second string may be smaller than the value of the 
   first substring.  Thus, T080000/T210000 identifies the range from 
   0800 until 2100, while T210000/T080000 identifies the range from 
   2100 until 0800 of the following day."
