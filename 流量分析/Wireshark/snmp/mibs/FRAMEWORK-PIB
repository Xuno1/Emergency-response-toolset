          "This object indicates the type of guidance related
          to the noted limitation (as indicated by the
          frwkCompLimitsType attribute) that is provided
          in the frwkCompLimitsGuidance attribute.

          A value of 'none(1)' means that no additional
          guidance is provided for the noted limitation type.

          A value of 'lengthMin(2)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to the minimum
          acceptable length for the value of the identified
          component. A corresponding class instance
          specifying the 'lengthMax(3)' value is required
          in conjunction with this sub-type.

          A value of 'lengthMax(3)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to the maximum
          acceptable length for the value of the identified
          component. A corresponding class instance
          specifying the 'lengthMin(2)' value is required
          in conjunction with this sub-type.

          A value of 'rangeMin(4)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to the lower bound
          of the range for the value of the identified
          component. A corresponding class instance
          specifying the 'rangeMax(5)' value is required
          in conjunction with this sub-type.

          A value of 'rangeMax(5)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to the upper bound



          of the range for the value of the identified
          component. A corresponding class instance
          specifying the 'rangeMin(4)' value is required
          in conjunction with this sub-type.

          A value of 'enumMin(6)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to the lowest
          enumeration acceptable for the value of the
          identified component. A corresponding
          class instance specifying the 'enumMax(7)'
          value is required in conjunction with this sub-type.

          A value of 'enumMax(7)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to the largest
          enumeration acceptable for the value of the
          identified component. A corresponding
          class instance specifying the 'enumMin(6)'
          value is required in conjunction with this sub-type.

          A value of 'enumOnly(8)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to a single
          enumeration acceptable for the value of the
          identified component.

          A value of 'valueOnly(9)' means that the guidance
          attribute provides data related to a single
          value that is acceptable for the identified
          component.

          A value of 'bitMask(10)' means that the guidance
          attribute is a bit mask such that all the combinations of
          bits set in the bitmask are acceptable values for the
          identified component which should be an attribute of type

          'BITS'.

          For example, an implementation of the frwkIpFilter class may
          be limited in several ways, such as address mask, protocol
          and Layer 4 port options. These limitations could be
          exported using this PRC with the following instances:

          Component        Type                 Sub-Type   Guidance
          ------------------------------------------------------------
          DstPrefixLength  attrValueSupLimited  valueOnly   24
          SrcPrefixLength  attrValueSupLimited  valueOnly   24
          Protocol         attrValueSupLimited  rangeMin    10
          Protocol         attrValueSupLimited  rangeMax    20




          The above entries describe a number of limitations that
          may be in effect for the frwkIpFilter class on a given
          device. The limitations include restrictions on acceptable
          values for certain attributes.

          Also, an implementation of a PRC may be limited in the ways
          it can be accessed. For instance, for a fictitious PRC
          dscpMapEntry, which has a PIB-ACCESS of 'install-notify':

          Component    Type              SubType  Guidance
          ------------------------------------------------------------
          dscpMapEntry prcLimitedNotify  none     zero-length string."

             value must be a zero-length string.

             The format of the guidance value, if one is present as
             indicated by the frwkCompLimitsSubType attribute,
             is described by the following table. Note that the
             format of guidance value is dictated by the base-type of
             the component whose limitation is being exported,
             interpreted in the context of the frwkCompLimitsType and
             frwkCompLimitsSubType values. Any other restrictions
             (such as size/range/enumerated value) on the guidance
             value MUST be complied with according to the definition
             of the component for which guidance is being specified.

             Note that numbers are encoded in network byte order.

          Setting the frwk802FilterEtherTypeMin object to -1 indicates
          that EtherType data should not be considered during traffic
          classification.

          Note that the position of the EtherType field depends on
          the underlying frame format. For Ethernet-II encapsulation,
          the EtherType field follows the 802 MAC source address. For
          802.2 LLC/SNAP encapsulation, the EtherType value follows



          the Organization Code field in the 802.2 SNAP header. The
        value that is tested with regard to this filter component
        therefore depends on the data link layer frame format being
        used. If this 802 filter component is active when there is
        no EtherType field in a frame (e.g., 802.2 LLC), a match is
