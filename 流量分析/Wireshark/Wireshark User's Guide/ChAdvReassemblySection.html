<p>Network protocols often need to transport large chunks of data which are
complete in themselves, e.g., when transferring a file. The underlying protocol
might not be able to handle that chunk size (e.g., limitation of the network
packet size), or is stream-based like TCP, which doesn’t know data chunks at
all.</p>
<p>In that case the network protocol has to handle the chunk boundaries itself and
(if required) spread the data over multiple packets. It obviously also needs a
mechanism to determine the chunk boundaries on the receiving side.</p>
<p>Wireshark calls this mechanism reassembly, although a specific protocol
specification might use a different term for this (e.g., desegmentation,
defragmentation, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_how_wireshark_handles_it"></a>7.8.2. How Wireshark Handles It</h3></div></div></div>

<p>For some of the network protocols Wireshark knows of, a mechanism is implemented
to find, decode and display these chunks of data. Wireshark will try to find the
corresponding packets of this chunk, and will show the combined data as
additional tabs in the “Packet Bytes” pane (for information about this pane.
See <a class="xref" href="ChUsePacketBytesPaneSection.html" title="3.20. The “Packet Bytes” Pane">Section 3.20, “The “Packet Bytes” Pane”</a>).</p>

</div></div><br class="figure-break">
<p>Reassembly might take place at several protocol layers, so it’s possible that
multiple tabs in the “Packet Bytes” pane appear.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.svg"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">

<p>For example, in a <span class="emphasis"><em>HTTP</em></span> GET response, the requested data (e.g., an HTML page) is
returned. Wireshark will show the hex dump of the data in a new tab
“Uncompressed entity body” in the “Packet Bytes” pane.</p>
<p>Reassembly is enabled in the preferences by default but can be disabled in the
preferences for the protocol in question. Enabling or disabling reassembly
settings for a protocol typically requires two things:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
The lower-level protocol (e.g., TCP) must support reassembly. Often this
reassembly can be enabled or disabled via the protocol preferences.
</li><li class="listitem">
The higher-level protocol (e.g., HTTP) must use the reassembly mechanism to
reassemble fragmented protocol data. This too can often be enabled or disabled
via the protocol preferences.
</li></ol></div>
<p>The tooltip of the higher-level protocol setting will notify you if and which
lower-level protocol setting also has to be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ChAdvReassemblyTcp"></a>7.8.3. TCP Reassembly</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Protocols such as HTTP or TLS are likely to span multiple TCP segments. The
TCP protocol preference “Allow subdissector to reassemble TCP streams” (enabled
by default) makes it possible for Wireshark to collect a contiguous sequence of
TCP segments and hand them over to the higher-level protocol (for example, to
reconstruct a full HTTP message). All but the final segment will be marked with
“[TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]” in the packet list.</p>
<p>Disable this preference to reduce memory and processing overhead if you are only
interested in TCP sequence number analysis (<a class="xref" href="ChAdvTCPAnalysis.html" title="7.5. TCP Analysis">Section 7.5, “TCP Analysis”</a>). Keep in mind,
though, that higher-level protocols might be wrongly dissected. For example,
HTTP messages could be shown as “Continuation” and TLS records could be shown as
“Ignored Unknown Record”. Such results can also be observed if you start
capturing while a TCP connection was already started or when TCP segments
are lost or delivered out-of-order.</p>
<p>To reassemble of out-of-order TCP segments, the TCP protocol preference
“Reassemble out-of-order segments” (currently disabled by default) must be
enabled in addition to the previous preference.
If all packets are received in-order, this preference will not have any effect.
Otherwise (if missing segments are encountered while sequentially processing a
packet capture), it is assuming that the new and missing segments belong to the
same PDU. Caveats:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Lost packets are assumed to be received out-of-order or retransmitted later.
Applications usually retransmit segments until these are acknowledged, but if
the packet capture drops packets, then Wireshark will not be able to
reconstruct the TCP stream. In such cases, you can try to disable this
preference and hopefully have a partial dissection instead of seeing just
“[TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]” for every TCP segment.
</li><li class="listitem">
When doing a capture in monitor mode (IEEE 802.11), packets are more likely to
get lost due to signal reception issues. In that case it is recommended to
disable the option.
</li><li class="listitem">
If the new and missing segments are in fact part of different PDUs,
then processing is currently delayed until no more segments are missing, even
if the begin of the missing segments completed a PDU. For example, assume six
segments forming two PDUs <code class="literal">ABC</code> and <code class="literal">DEF</code>. When received as <code class="literal">ABECDF</code>, an
application can start processing the first PDU after receiving <code class="literal">ABEC</code>.
Wireshark however requires the missing segment <code class="literal">D</code> to be received as well.
This issue will be addressed in the future.
</li><li class="listitem">
In the GUI and during a two-pass dissection (<code class="literal">tshark -2</code>), the previous
scenario will display both PDUs in the packet with last segment (<code class="literal">F</code>) rather
than displaying it in the first packet that has the final missing segment of a
PDU. This issue will be addressed in the future.
</li><li class="listitem">
When enabled, fields such as the SMB “Time from request” (<code class="literal">smb.time</code>) might be
smaller if the request follows other out-of-order segments (this reflects
application behavior). If the previous scenario however occurs, then the time
of the request is based on the frame where all missing segments are received.
</li></ul></div>
<p>Regardless of the setting of these two reassembly-related preferences, you can
always use the “Follow TCP Stream” option (<a class="xref" href="ChAdvFollowStreamSection.html" title="7.2. Following Protocol Streams">Section 7.2, “Following Protocol Streams”</a>) which
displays segments in the expected order.</p>
