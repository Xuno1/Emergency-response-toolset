<p>Several network protocols use checksums to ensure data integrity. Applying
checksums as described here is also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>redundancy checking</em></span>.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>What are checksums for?</b></p></div></div></div>

<p>Checksums are used to ensure the integrity of data portions for data
transmission or storage. A checksum is basically a calculated summary of such a
data portion.</p>
<p>Network data transmissions often produce errors, such as toggled, missing or
duplicated bits. As a result, the data received might not be identical to the
data transmitted, which is obviously a bad thing.</p>
<p>Because of these transmission errors, network protocols very often use checksums
to detect such errors. The transmitter will calculate a checksum of the data and
transmits the data together with the checksum. The receiver will calculate the
checksum of the received data with the same algorithm as the transmitter. If the
received and calculated checksums don’t match a transmission error has occurred.</p>
<p>Some checksum algorithms are able to recover (simple) errors by calculating
where the expected error must be and repairing it.</p>
<p>If there are errors that cannot be recovered, the receiving side throws away the
packet. Depending on the network protocol, this data loss is simply ignored or
the sending side needs to detect this loss somehow and retransmits the required
packet(s).</p>
<p>Using a checksum drastically reduces the number of undetected transmission
errors. However, the usual checksum algorithms cannot guarantee an error
detection of 100%, so a very small number of transmission errors may remain
undetected.</p>
<p>There are several different kinds of checksum algorithms; an example of an often
used checksum algorithm is CRC32. The checksum algorithm actually chosen for a
specific network protocol will depend on the expected error rate of the network
medium, the importance of error detection, the processor load to perform the
calculation, the performance needed and many other things.</p>

<p>Wireshark will validate the checksums of many protocols, e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, etc.</p>
<p>It will do the same calculation as a “normal receiver” would do, and shows the
checksum fields in the packet details with a comment, e.g., [correct] or
[invalid, must be 0x12345678].</p>
<p>Checksum validation can be switched off for various protocols in the Wireshark
protocol preferences, e.g., to (very slightly) increase performance.</p>
<p>If the checksum validation is enabled and it detected an invalid checksum,
features like packet reassembly won’t be processed. This is avoided as
incorrect connection data could “confuse” the internal database.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_checksum_offloading"></a>7.10.2. Checksum Offloading</h3></div></div></div>

<p>The checksum calculation might be done by the network driver, protocol driver or
even in hardware.</p>
<p>For example: The Ethernet transmitting hardware calculates the Ethernet CRC32
checksum and the receiving hardware validates this checksum. If the received
checksum is wrong Wireshark won’t even see the packet, as the Ethernet hardware
internally throws away the packet.</p>
<p>Higher-level checksums are “traditionally” calculated by the protocol
implementation and the completed packet is then handed over to the hardware.</p>
<p>Recent network hardware can perform advanced features such as IP checksum
calculation, also known as checksum offloading. The network driver won’t
calculate the checksum itself but will simply hand over an empty (zero or
garbage filled) checksum field to the hardware.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.svg"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Checksum offloading often causes confusion as the network packets to be
transmitted are handed over to Wireshark before the checksums are actually
calculated. Wireshark gets these “empty” checksums and displays them as
invalid, even though the packets will contain valid checksums when they leave
the network hardware later.</p>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>Checksum offloading can be confusing and having a lot of [invalid] messages on
the screen can be quite annoying. As mentioned above, invalid checksums may lead
to unreassembled packets, making the analysis of the packet data much harder.</p>
<p>You can do two things to avoid this checksum offloading problem:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Turn off the checksum offloading in the network driver, if this option is available.
</li><li class="listitem">
Turn off checksum validation of the specific protocol in the Wireshark preferences.
Recent releases of Wireshark disable checksum validation by default due to the
prevalence of offloading in modern hardware and operating systems.
