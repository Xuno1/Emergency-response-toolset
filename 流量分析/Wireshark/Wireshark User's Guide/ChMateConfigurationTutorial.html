<p>We’ll show a MATE configuration that first creates Gops for every DNS and HTTP
request, then it ties the Gops together in a Gop based on the host. Finally,
we’ll separate into different Gogs request coming from different users.</p>
<p>With this MATE configuration loaded we can:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
use <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_use.Duration &gt; 5.5</strong></span> to filter frames based on the time it takes
to load a complete page from the DNS request to resolve its name until the last
image gets loaded.
</li><li class="listitem">
use <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_use.client == "10.10.10.20" &amp;&amp; mate.http_use.host == "www.example.com"</strong></span>
to isolate DNS and HTTP packets related to a visit of a certain user.
</li><li class="listitem">
use <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_req.Duration &gt; 1.5</strong></span> to filter all the packets of HTTP requests
that take more than 1.5 seconds to complete.
</li></ul></div>
<p>The complete config file is available on the Wireshark Wiki:
<a class="ulink" href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/Mate/Tutorial" target="_top">https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/Mate/Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Note: This example uses <span class="emphasis"><em>dns.qry.name</em></span> which is defined since Wireshark
version 0.10.9. Supposing you have a mate plugin already installed you can test
it with the current Wireshark version.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_a_gop_for_dns_requests"></a>12.4.1. A Gop for DNS requests</h3></div></div></div>

<p>First we’ll tell MATE how to create a Gop for each DNS request/response.</p>
<p>MATE needs to know what makes a DNS PDU. We describe it this using a Pdu
declaration:</p>
<pre class="screen">Pdu dns_pdu Proto dns Transport ip {
  Extract addr From ip.addr;
  Extract dns_id From dns.id;
  Extract dns_resp From dns.flags.response;
};</pre>
<p>Using <span class="emphasis"><em>Proto dns</em></span> we tell MATE to create Pdus every time it finds <span class="emphasis"><em>dns</em></span>. Using
<span class="emphasis"><em>Transport ip</em></span> we inform MATE that some of the fields we are interested are
in the <span class="emphasis"><em>ip</em></span> part of the frame. Finally, we tell MATE to import <span class="emphasis"><em>ip.addr</em></span> as
<span class="emphasis"><em>addr</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>dns.id</em></span> as <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_id</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>dns.flags.response</em></span> as <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_resp</em></span>.</p>
<p>Once we’ve told MATE how to extract <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_pdus</em></span> we’ll tell it how to match
requests and responses and group them into a Gop. For this we’ll use a <span class="emphasis"><em>Gop</em></span>
declaration to define the Gop, and then, <span class="emphasis"><em>Start</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Stop</em></span> statements to
tell it when the Gop starts and ends.</p>
<pre class="screen">Gop dns_req On dns_pdu Match (addr,addr,dns_id) {
  Start (dns_resp=0);
  Stop (dns_resp=1);
};</pre>
<p>Using the <span class="strong"><strong>Gop</strong></span> declaration we tell MATE that the <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> of the Gop is <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_req</em></span>,
that <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_pdus</em></span> can become members of the Gop, and what is the key used to match
the Pdus to the Gop.</p>
<p>The key for this Gop is <span class="emphasis"><em>"addr, addr, dns_id"</em></span>. That means that in order to
belong to the same Gop, <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_pdus</em></span> have to have both addresses and the
<span class="emphasis"><em>request id</em></span> identical. We then instruct MATE that a <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_req</em></span> starts whenever
a <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_pdu</em></span> matches <span class="emphasis"><em>"dns_resp=0"</em></span> and that it stops when another <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_pdu</em></span>
matches <span class="emphasis"><em>"dns_resp=1"</em></span>.</p>
<p>At this point, if we open a capture file using this configuration, we are able
to use a display filter <span class="strong"><strong>mate.dns_req.Time &gt; 1</strong></span> to see only the packets of
DNS requests that take more than one second to complete.</p>
<p>We can use a display filter <span class="strong"><strong>mate.dns_req &amp;&amp; ! mate.dns_req.Time</strong></span> to find
requests for which no response was given. <span class="strong"><strong>mate.xxx.Time</strong></span> is set only for Gops
that have being stopped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_a_gop_for_http_requests"></a>12.4.2. A Gop for HTTP requests</h3></div></div></div>

<p>This other example creates a Gop for every HTTP request.</p>
<pre class="screen">Pdu http_pdu Proto http Transport tcp/ip {
  Extract addr From ip.addr;
  Extract port From tcp.port;
  Extract http_rq From http.request.method;
  Extract http_rs From http.response;
  DiscardPduData true;
};

Gop http_req On http_pdu Match (addr, addr, port, port) {
  Start (http_rq);
  Stop (http_rs);
};</pre>
<p>So, if we open a capture using this configuration</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
filtering with <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_req.Time &gt; 1</strong></span> will give all the requests where the
response header takes more than one second to come
</li><li class="listitem">
filtering with <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_req.Duration &gt; 1.5</strong></span> will show those request that
take more than 1.5 seconds to complete.
</li></ul></div>
<p>You have to know that <span class="strong"><strong>mate.xxx.Time</strong></span> gives the time in seconds between the pdu
matching the GopStart and the Pdu matching the GopStop (yes, you can create
timers using this!). On the other hand, <span class="strong"><strong>mate.xxx.Duration</strong></span> gives you the time
passed between the GopStart and the last pdu assigned to that Gop regardless
whether it is a stop or not. After the GopStop, Pdus matching the Gop’s Key will
still be assigned to the same Gop as far as they don’t match the GopStart, in
which case a new Gop with the same key will be created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_getting_dns_and_http_together_into_a_gog"></a>12.4.3. Getting DNS and HTTP together into a Gog</h3></div></div></div>

<p>We’ll tie together to a single Gog all the http packets belonging to requests
and responses to a certain host and the dns request and response used to resolve
its domain name using the Pdu and Gop definitions of the previous examples</p>
<p>To be able to group DNS and HTTP requests together, we need to import into the
Pdus and Gops some part of information that both those protocols share. Once the
Pdus and Gops have been defined, we can use <span class="emphasis"><em>Extract</em></span> (for Pdus) and
<span class="emphasis"><em>Extract</em></span> (for Gops) statements to tell MATE what other protocol fields are to
be added to Pdus' and Gops' AVPLs. We add the following statements to the
appropriate declarations:</p>
<pre class="screen">Extract host From http.host; // to Pdu http_pdu as the last Extract in the list
Extra (host); // to Gop http_req after the Stop

Extract host From dns.qry.name; // to Pdu dns_pdu as the last Extract in the list
Extra (host); // to Gop dns_req after the Stop</pre>
<p>Here we’ve told MATE to import <span class="emphasis"><em>http.host</em></span> into <span class="emphasis"><em>http_pdu</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>dns.qry.name</em></span>
into <span class="emphasis"><em>dns_pdu</em></span> as <span class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span>. We also have to tell MATE to copy the <span class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span>
attribute from the Pdus to the Gops, we do this using <span class="emphasis"><em>Extra</em></span>.</p>
<p>Once we have all the data we need in Pdus and Gops, we tell MATE what makes
different Gops belong to a certain Gog.</p>
<pre class="screen">Gog http_use {
  Member http_req (host);
  Member dns_req (host);
  Expiration 0.75;
};</pre>
<p>Using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Gog</em></span> declaration, we tell MATE to define a Gog type <span class="emphasis"><em>Named</em></span>
<span class="emphasis"><em>http_use</em></span> whose expiration is 0.75 seconds after all the Gops that belong to it
had been stopped. After that time, an eventual new Gop with the same key match
will create a new Gog instead of been added to the previous Gog.</p>
<p>Using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Member</em></span> statements, we tell MATE that <span class="strong"><strong>http_req*s with the same
*host</strong></span> belong to the same Gog, same thing for *dns_req*s.</p>
<p>So far we have instructed mate to group every packet related to sessions towards
a certain host. At this point if we open a capture file and:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
a display filter <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_use.Duration &gt; 5</strong></span> will show only those requests
that have taken more than 5 seconds to complete starting from the DNS request
and ending with the last packet of the http responses.
</li><li class="listitem">
a display filter <span class="strong"><strong>mate.http_use.host == "www.w3c.org"</strong></span> will show all the
packets (both DNS and HTTP) related to the requests directed to www.w3c.org
</li></ul></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_separating_requests_from_multiple_users"></a>12.4.4. Separating requests from multiple users</h3></div></div></div>

<p>"Houston: we’ve had a problem here."</p>
<p>This configuration works fine if used for captures taken at the client’s side
but deeper in the network we’d got a real mess. Requests from many users get
mixed together into <span class="emphasis"><em>http_uses</em></span>. Gogs are created and stopped almost randomly
(depending on the timing in which Gops start and stop). How do we get requests
from individual users separated from each other?</p>
<p>MATE has a tool that can be used to resolve this kind of grouping issues. This
tool are the <span class="emphasis"><em>Transforms</em></span>. Once defined, they can be applied against Pdus,
Gops and Gogs and they might replace or insert more attributes based on what’s
there. We’ll use them to create an attribute named client, using which we’ll
separate different requests.</p>
<p>For DNS we need the ip.src of the request moved into the Gop only from the DNS
request.</p>
<p>So we first tell MATE to import ip.src as client:</p>
<pre class="screen">Extract client From ip.src;</pre>
<p>Next, we tell MATE to replace ( <span class="strong"><strong>dns_resp=1, client</strong></span> ) with just <span class="strong"><strong>dns_resp=1</strong></span> in
the Pdu. That way, we’ll keep the attribute <span class="strong"><strong>client</strong></span> only in the DNS request
Pdus (i.e., packets coming from the client).To do so, we have to add a
<span class="emphasis"><em>Transform</em></span> declaration (in this case, with just one clause) before the Pdu
declaration which uses it:</p>
<pre class="screen">Transform rm_client_from_dns_resp {
  Match (dns_resp=1, client) Replace (dns_resp=1);
};</pre>
<p>Next, we invoke the transform by adding the following line after the <span class="emphasis"><em>Extract</em></span>
list of the dns_pdu Pdu:</p>
<pre class="screen">  Transform rm_client_from_dns_resp;</pre>
<p>HTTP is a little trickier. We have to remove the attribute carrying ip.src from
both the response and the "continuations" of the response, but as there is
nothing to filter on for the continuations, we have to add a fake attribute
first. And then we have to remove client when the fake attribute appears.
This is possible due to the fact that the <span class="emphasis"><em>Match</em></span> clauses in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Transform</em></span>
are executed one by one until one of them succeeds. First, we declare another
two <span class="emphasis"><em>Transforms</em></span>:</p>
<pre class="screen">Transform rm_client_from_http_resp1 {
  Match (http_rq); //first match wins so the request won't get the not_rq attribute inserted
  Match Every (addr) Insert (not_rq); //this line won't be evaluated if the first one matched so not_rq won't be inserted to requests
};

Transform rm_client_from_http_resp2 {
  Match (not_rq, client) Replace (); //replace "client and not_rq" with nothing (will happen only in the response and eventual parts of it)
};</pre>
<p>Next, we add another <span class="emphasis"><em>Extract</em></span> statement to the <span class="emphasis"><em>http_pdu</em></span> declaration, and
apply both <span class="emphasis"><em>Transforms</em></span> declared above in a proper order:</p>
<pre class="screen">  Extract client From ip.src;
  Transform rm_client_from_http_resp1, rm_client_from_http_resp2;</pre>
<p>In MATE, all the <span class="emphasis"><em>Transform_s listed for an item will be evaluated, while
inside a single _Transform</em></span>, the evaluation will stop at the first successful
<span class="emphasis"><em>Match</em></span> clause. That’s why we first just match <span class="emphasis"><em>http_rq</em></span> to get out of the
first sequence before adding the <span class="emphasis"><em>not_rq</em></span> attribute. Then we apply the second
<span class="emphasis"><em>Transform</em></span> which removes both <span class="emphasis"><em>not_rq</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> if both are there. Yes,
_Transform_s are cumbersome, but they are very useful.</p>
<p>Once we got all what we need in the Pdus, we have to tell MATE to copy the
attribute <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> from the Pdus to the respective Gops, by adding client to
<span class="emphasis"><em>Extra</em></span> lists of both Gop declarations:</p>
<pre class="screen">Extra (host, client);</pre>
<p>On top of that, we need to modify the old declarations of Gop key to new ones
that include both <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span>. So we change the Gog <span class="strong"><strong>Member</strong></span>
declarations the following way:</p>
<pre class="screen">  Member http_req (host, client);
  Member dns_req (host, client);</pre>
<p>Now we got it, every "usage" gets its own Gog.</p>
