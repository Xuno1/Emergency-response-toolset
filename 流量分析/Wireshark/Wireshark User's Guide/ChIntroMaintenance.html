<p>Wireshark was initially developed by Gerald Combs. Ongoing development and
maintenance of Wireshark is handled by the Wireshark team, a loose group of
individuals who fix bugs and provide new functionality.</p>
<p>There have also been a large number of people who have contributed
protocol dissectors to Wireshark, and it is expected that this will
continue. You can find a list of the people who have contributed code to
Wireshark by checking the about dialog box of Wireshark, or at the
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.wireshark.org/about.html#authors" target="_top">authors</a> page on the Wireshark web site.</p>

Other people who find your contributions useful will appreciate them, and you
will know that you have helped people in the same way that the developers of
Wireshark have helped you.
</li><li class="listitem">
The developers of Wireshark can further improve your changes or implement
additional features on top of your code, which may also benefit you.
</li><li class="listitem">
The maintainers and developers of Wireshark will maintain your code,
fixing it when API changes or other changes are made, and generally keeping it
in tune with what is happening with Wireshark. So when Wireshark is updated
(which is often), you can get a new Wireshark version from the website
and your changes will already be included without any additional effort from you.
