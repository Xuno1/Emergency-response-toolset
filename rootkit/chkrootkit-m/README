                           chkrootkit-m 0.2

      chkrotkit-m is a chkrootkit Python port for mobile phones.

Both chkrotkit-m and chkrotkit are available at:
http://www.chkrootkit.org/

NOTICE: This tool is in alpha stage, problems are expected.

Install:

chkrootkit-m is written in Python, so you'll need to install the
Python environment on your mobile phone.

For example, S60 based phones can download it at:
http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/pythonfors60/

Usage:

If you have Python-Shell installed and Python is installed on your
mobile phone c: drive, you just need to copy chkrootkit.py and
chk.conf to the Python directory and select the "run scripts" option.

If this procedure doesn't work try to run it manually:

Start Python, select the Interactive console option and exec
chkrootkit, for example:

>>> exec file('c:\\python\\chkrootkit.py')

after that use the [options] button and select 'Search Malwares'.


I hope this helps.
